# EWC Web Client

## Installation

As standard, this project uses a package.json. It's recommended you install yarn and vite as global executables though.

## Development

The single command `vite` is used for iterative develeopment.

There are other scripts to be found in package.json under the key "scripts".

## Kendo UI Components

Kendo UI is an exception to the other components, as although the components
are available freely, you must be licensed for them. Once you are, you can
create a `kendo-ui-license.txt` file.

**N.B.** do not forget to activate the license:

```
yarn run kendo-ui-license activate
```
